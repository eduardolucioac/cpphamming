cpphamming - hamming process to modify and recover files taking their bit 4 in 4
=============

What is cpphamming?
-----
The Hamming code is a linear block code developed by Richard Hamming and is used in signal processing and telecommunications. This application uses this process to modify and recover files taking their bit 4 in 4 using the hamming process.

Compile and use!
-----

 * Linux (The cool and good way!) =D

For Linux it is enough have g++ installed!

 * To compile and use on Linux...

```
cd "/<pat_to_cpphamming>/cpphamming/"

g++ ./hamming_enc.cpp -o hamming_enc
./hamming_enc metamorphosis.txt metamorphosis_enc.bin

g++ ./hamming_err.cpp -o hamming_err
./hamming_err metamorphosis_enc.bin metamorphosis_err.bin

g++ ./hamming_dec.cpp -o hamming_dec
./hamming_dec metamorphosis_err.bin metamorphosis_dec.txt
```

 * Windows (The "hard" way!)

For windows use Cygwin...

http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download/cygwin

And install as instructions here...

http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/cygwin/part1

NOTE I: For "path" use "C:\cygwin64\bin;C:\cygwin64\usr\sbin" (setup-x86_64.exe).

NOTE II: This version does not support "C++ 2011"/"C++11" by default, so we have to add the "-std=c++11" parameter.

NOTE III: Use the command (cmd.exe) to run g++.

 * To compile and use on Windows...

```
cd "<letter>:\<pat_to_cpphamming>\cpphamming"

g++ -std=c++11 hamming_enc.cpp -o hamming_enc.exe
hamming_enc.exe metamorphosis.txt metamorphosis_enc.bin

g++ -std=c++11 hamming_err.cpp -o hamming_err.exe
hamming_err.exe metamorphosis_enc.bin metamorphosis_err.bin

g++ -std=c++11 hamming_dec.cpp -o hamming_dec.exe
hamming_dec.exe metamorphosis_err.bin metamorphosis_dec.txt
```
